# IDS706-WEEK2 [![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/Jeremy_Tan_IDS706_Week2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Jeremy_Tan_IDS706_Week2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
This repo contains work for mini-project 2. It sets up an environment on codespaces and uses Github Actions to run a Makefile for the following: `make install`, `make test`, `make format`, `make lint`. It loads the iris dataset and runs a simple function to generate descriptive statistics on the dataset. I've also included a general describe function that uses a csv link as an argument. 

Some important stuff included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Dockerfile`

* A base set of libraries for devops and web

* `githubactions` 

## Purpose of project
The purpose of this project is to extend from the previous project (making a python template) and generate descriptive statistics on datasets using Pandas. I made two functions in main.py: "describe_iris(summary)" and "general_describe(csv)". The former function provides descriptive statistics on only the iris dataset while the latter dataset provides descriptive statistics on any csv file a user passes in. I test both functions in test_main with "test_describe_iris_and_general_describe()". The second part of the project is to generate visualizations of the datasets and generate a report. I include a generateed pdf of one of the datasets I chose, congress-terms.csv, using ydata-profiling. I've include pictures of the visualizations and the data returned from .describe() and .median() for your reference. 

## Preparation
1. open codespaces 
2. wait for container to be built with requiremnts.txt installed

## Check format and test errors
1. Format code `make format`
2. Lint code `make lint`

3. Test code `make test`

## Visualizations
Visualizations can be ran by using `python test_main.py` calling `test_viz_iris_and_general()`

## Some summary statistics of both datasets
Summary reports can be generated by ydata-profiling by using `python test_main.py` calling `test_generate_summary_report()` but I've attached relevant summary statistics
