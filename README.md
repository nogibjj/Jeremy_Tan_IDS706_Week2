# IDS706-python-template [![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/Jeremy_Tan_IDS706_Week2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Jeremy_Tan_IDS706_Week2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
This repo contains work for mini-project 2. It sets up an environment on codespaces and uses Github Actions to run a Makefile for the following: `make install`, `make test`, `make format`, `make lint`. It loads the iris dataset and runs a simple function to generate descriptive statistics on the dataset. I've also included a general describe function that uses a csv link as an argument. 

Some important stuff included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Dockerfile`

* A base set of libraries for devops and web

* `githubactions`
